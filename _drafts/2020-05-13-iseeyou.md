A few weeks ago, I became curious with how to disable the camera LED on my macbook, or if that was even possible. I know that I am *FAR* from the first person to ask this question (I mean just about everyone has tape overy there webcam) but I realized I did not have a definitive answer as to whether this was actually possible.

Sure enough, basically the first thing that comes up is the [iSeeYou](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-brocker.pdf) paper. They demonstrate how on macbooks with iSight cameras, you can reprogram the firmware (from userspace!) of the microcontroller controlling the camera to bypass the LED.

In this blog post, I'll be going through this paper, trying to reproduce the steps they took and implement the final result.

### The vulnerability

As I hinted at before, the camera is not just a single IC, but a Cypress EZ-USB microcontroller and a Micron image sensor (and an EEPROM). The following diagram shows the architecture of the camera (note: This diagram along with all others were taken from the paper. All credits to the original authors):

The LED is tied to the `STANDY` line; therefore normally, whenever `STANDBY` is asserted (the camera is disabled) the LED will be off and when STANDBY is deasserted (the camera is enabled) the LED will be illuminated.

However, Brocker and Checkoway find that the MT9V112 (the image sensor) can be configured to *ignore* the `STANDBY` signal, even when it's producing data on the `DOUT` lines. Since the image sensor is configured through the EZ-USB, if we can program the EZ-USB (which we can), we can configure the image sensor.

### Getting the firmware

When the EZ-USB first powers up, it enumerates with a product ID signifying that it has no firmware loaded. The `AppleUSBVideoSupport` kext plugin (located in `/System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBVideoSupport.kext/Contents/MacOS`) then matches on this product ID (and it's vendor ID). The kext proceeds to program the device with firmware embedded in the binary itself. Once programmed, the EZ-USB is reset and "renumerates" with a different product ID, meaning that is has firmware.

So in order to look at the EZ-USB's firmware, we first need to take a look at the `AppleUSBVideoSupport` kext. While kexts are written in C++, thankfully this binary is very simple.

We start by looking at the `AppleVideoUSBCamera::start` method
